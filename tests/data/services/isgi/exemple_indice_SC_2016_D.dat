 # Converted to IAGA2002 format by the International Service of      |
 #  Geomagnetic indices (ISGI, http://isgi.unistra.fr)               |
 # MDUR : mean SC duration or rise-time in minutes                   |
 # MAMP : mean amplitude in nT. value 9999 if undefined              |
 # CODES : qualification codes corresponding to each observatory.    |
 #   3 or 2: the event can be unmistakably identified as being an SC |
 #   from the single record under consideration. Number 3 is imposed |
 #   instead of 2 when the following three features are present: a)  |
 #   very sharp change of rhythm, b) large amplitude of the sudden   |
 #   movement, c) remarkably morphology of it.                       |
 #   1: means that the event seen in this particular record is       |
 #   possibly an SC, but it is not sufficiently clear by itself for  |
 #   stating that it is a true SC: One need records from other       |
 #   longitudes for getting a firm judgement                         |
 #   0: means that the event, such as it appears in the record, could|
 #   escape from the attention of the observer, or does not deserve  |
 #   to be called an SC.                                             |
 #   Left blank if undefined.                                        |
 # TYPE : type of event, SSC (Storm Sudden Commencement) or          |
 #   SI (Sudden Impulse). Left blank if undefined                    |
 # OBSERVATORIES : Code of the five low latitude observatories       |
 # DURATION : duration or rise-time in minutes for each observatory  |
 # AMPLITUDE : amplitude in nT for each observatory                  |
